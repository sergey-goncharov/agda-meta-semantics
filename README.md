# agda-meta-semantics
Categorical semantic toolset in Agda

The idea of this repository is to collect categorical tools for semantics, and for mechanized reasoning about semantics. 

The underlying notion of category is chosen to be the one, implemented in the [agda-categories](https://github.com/agda/agda-categories) library. 

A primary focus at the moment is formalization of the concepts and results of the __Higher-Order Mathematical Operational Semantics__ program, started in the paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3571215
